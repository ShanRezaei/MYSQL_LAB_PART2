PREPARED STATEMENTS	

Create the following prepared statements and execute them in order to test them.
Remember the prepared statements are not saved, so please save them in a file for lab correction.

1. Show all the animals (id, name, sex)

PREPARE statement1 FROM 'SELECT id,name,sex FROM animal';
EXECUTE statement1;




2. Show all the animals by ? race_id (id, name, sex, dob, race_name)

PREPARE statement2 FROM 
'SELECT animal.id,animal.name,sex,dob,race.name,race_id FROM animal 
INNER JOIN race ON race.id=animal.race_id WHERE race_id=?';
 SET @a = 1;
SET @b=2;
SET @c=3;
SET @d=4;
SET @e=5;
SET @f=6;
SET @g=7;
SET @h=8;
SET @i=9;
EXECUTE statement2 USING @a;
EXECUTE statement2 USING @b;
EXECUTE statement2 USING @c;
EXECUTE statement2 USING @d;
EXECUTE statement2 USING @e;
EXECUTE statement2 USING @f;
EXECUTE statement2 USING @g;
EXECUTE statement2 USING @h;
EXECUTE statement2 USING @i;





3. Show all the animals by ? race_id and ? species_id (id, name, sex, race_name, species_name)

PREPARE statement3 FROM 
'SELECT animal.id,animal.name,sex,race.name,animal.race_id,animal.species_id,species.current_name FROM animal 
INNER JOIN race ON race.id=animal.race_id 
INNER JOIN species ON species.id=animal.species_id
WHERE animal.race_id=? AND animal.species_id=?';

SET @race_id = 2;
SET @species_id = 1;

EXECUTE statement3 USING @race_id, @species_id;







4. Which specie has less than ? males and ? females (id, name, sex, race_name, species_name)
where ? is a number of animals

PREPARE statement4 FROM 
'SELECT   sex,animal.species_id ,COUNT(*) FROM animal
 INNER JOIN species ON species.id=animal.species_id  
GROUP BY animal.species_id
 HAVING (animal.sex='M' AND COUNT(sex)>10) OR (animal.sex='F' AND COUNT(sex)>4)';

SET @m_s = 12;
SET @f_s= 6;


EXECUTE statement4 USING @m_s, @f_s;
 




5. Assuming the inflation rises 20% more every year, show the prices of ? animals for the ? year based on specie's race (id, name, sex, race_name, species_name)
where first argument is the number of animals to show and the second argument is the year number

SET @inflation ='SELECT a.id, a.name, a.sex, r.name, s.current_name, r.price AS 'base price', r.price * ROUND(POWER(1.2, ? - YEAR(a.dob)),2) AS 'Inflation'
					 FROM animal a
                    INNER  JOIN race r
						ON a.race_id = r.id
					INNER JOIN species s
						ON a.species_id = s.id
					 ORDER BY a.id
                     LIMIT ?';
                     
PREPARE ps_inflation
FROM @inflation;


SET @select_num_animals = 5;
SET @select_year = 2013;

EXECUTE ps_inflation USING @select_year, @select_num_animals;
